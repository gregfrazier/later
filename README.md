Raycast (Wolf3d Style) Canvas/Javascript

Simple raycasting with perspective correction, textured walls, floor and ceiling.

Very slow, probably due to the way I coded it and the limited fillrate of canvas. Really could use some refactoring; like most of my stuff on github, it's a hack job.

Runs best in Firefox. Chrome and IE11 are doable, just slow. Runs like crud in Edge, something's wrong with the keypresses because there is huge latency.

The map at the top is a map editor, click to add or remove (you could use the console to dump the array to text)
